###Detect a sequences of similar structures in html and automatically construct xpath for them.

Useful to detect products, forms, polls etc on webpages.

Each detected sequence:

1. has not less than min_elements
2. has not less than mintreeheight
3. everything started from maxtreeheight is unimportant
4. similarity should be less than maxmismatch

Motto: just checking some ideas.

You will not find good code here. Because this is quick prototype now. 

Check "examples" dir for results.

Cheers.
